name: 'AcoRec: Diverse but relevant recommendations with Continuous Ant Colony Optimization'
description: This paper introduces a novel method called AcoRec, which employs an
  enhanced version of Continuous Ant Colony Optimization for hyper-parameter adjustment
  and integrates a non-deterministic model to generate diverse recommendation lists
  for cold-start-user and long-tail item recommendations by leveraging implicit data
  from collaborative filtering techniques. Continuous Ant Colony Optimization is revisited
  with the convenience and flexibility of deep-learning solid methods and extended
  within the AcoRec model. The approach computes stochastic variations of item probability
  values based on the initial predictions derived from a selected item similarity
  model. The structure of our model enables efficient handling of high-dimensional
  data while maintaining an effective balance between diversity and high recall, leading
  to recommendation lists that are both varied and highly relevant to user tastes.
  Our results demonstrate that AcoRec outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods
  and selected base similarity models across various evaluation scenarios using well-known
  evaluation metrics and popular datasets such as MovieLens, Pinterest, and Netflix
  in the top-N recommendation list manner.
